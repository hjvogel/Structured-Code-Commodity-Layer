# Structured Code Commodity Layer (SCCL)

Welcome to the Structured Code Commodity Layer (SCCL) repository! This project leverages cutting-edge Web3 technologies, composable architectures,  Finite State Machines (FSM), and DSPy / DSPyGEN CLI controlled AI-LLMs to create a robust, flexible, and scalable system for developing and optimizing tokenized digital static or dynamic assets - of algorithms and data structures. SCCL transforms and code into modular, tokenized WEB3 commodities, enabling dynamic composability, co-competition, and seamless integration for developing and optimizing virtual assets.

## Key Features

### 1. Composable Architecture
SCCL is built around modular, independently deployable components that can be dynamically selected and optimized based on performance metrics. This ensures high modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

### 2. Web3 and Tokenization
Every contribution to SCCL is tokenized, providing clear ownership and economic incentives for contributors. Our blockchain-backed infrastructure ensures transparency and fairness, enabling contributors to benefit directly from their optimizations.

### 3. Open Co-Competition and Value Co-Creation
We foster a competitive environment where the top-performing workflows and composables are dynamically selected based on real-time performance and sustainable economical metrics. This drives continuous improvement and open innovation.

### 4. Extensive Experimentation and Sandbox Environments
SCCL supports large-scale experiments and sandbox environments, allowing developers to test and refine their ideas in isolated conditions before deployment.

### 5. Legal Compliance and Product Stability
Our blockchain integrations prioritize legal compliance, product compliance, protocol stability and scalability. We might start with R3 Corda - SDX integration wrappers in Python, Hyperledger, and potentially Bitcoin (plain vanilla set in stone, restored op_codes, onchain scaled) to ensure a stable, regulation friendly and compliant environment.

### 6. Open Composables and Workflows Database
We provide an open database solution that cross-links all our and other open contributer's composables and workflows, making them easily accessible for other repository runners in the co-competition network. This openness ensures that anyone can join by forking our repository and contributes to the continuous evolution of next-generation composables. Pick a thing you can just improve or add and easy get started. Learn from the best - check the dashbords, they all should support Triple Entry Accounting.

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js and npm
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Dapr CLI
- Terraform (for infrastructure management)
- Vue CLI (for Vue/NUXT development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hjvogel/Structured-Code-Commodity-Layer.git
   cd Structured-Code-Commodity-Layer
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Initialize Dapr**:
   ```bash
   dapr init
   ```

   ```bash
   cd src/dashboard
   npm install
   cd ../..
   ```

5. **Build and run the Docker containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### Running Experiments

You can run predefined experiments in the `experiments` directory. For example, to run the first experiment:

1. Navigate to the experiment directory:
   ```bash
